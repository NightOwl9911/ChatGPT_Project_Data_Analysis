# 🏥 Using ChatGPT as a Data Analytics Copilot (Healthcare)
## ◼️ Project Goal & Motivation 🎯

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how to use **ChatGPT** effectively as a Data Analytics Copilot throughout a complete healthcare analytics workflow.

Rather than replacing analytical thinking, **ChatGPT** is used to:

1. Improve reasoning speed.

2. Ask better analytical questions.

3. Assist with data cleaning and visualization.

4. Reduce friction during EDA and modeling.

5. Support decision-making while keeping the analyst fully in control.

This project is inspired by **Luke Barousse’s** course on using **ChatGPT** for Data Analytics, where **ChatGPT** is positioned as a thinking partner, not a shortcut.

## ◼️ How ChatGPT Is Used (Copilot Mindset) 🧠
ChatGPT is used deliberately and transparently across the project to:

- 🧩 Clarify dataset and column meanings.

- 🧹 Suggest data cleaning strategies (validated by the analyst).

- 📊 Generate visualization ideas and code.

- 🔍 Help reason through EDA findings.

- 🧠 Assist with feature engineering logic.

- 📈 Discuss modeling choices and limitations.

All outputs from **ChatGPT** are reviewed, adapted, and validated by me (the analyst).

## ◼️ Prompting Strategy (Core Skill Demonstrated) ✍️ 

One goal of this course is how to form good prompts as it impacts directly on the analytical quality, the strategies for it include:

- Providing context (domain + objective).
- Specifying the role of ChatGPT (e.g., “act as a healthcare data analyst”).
- Asking for options, not answers.
- Iteratively refining prompts based on results.

## ◼️ Data Source 📂

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and selected to support an analysis of Hospital Length of Stay. According to its description, the data originates from the OECD database, which limits coverage to OECD member countries, and spans the period 1990 to 2018.

## ◼️ Methodology 🔬







## ◼️ Tools Used ⚙️

- Python: Core programming language for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and modeling.

- Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive environment for exploratory analysis, documentation, and iterative workflows.

- Visual Studio Code (VSCode): Primary development environment for writing, running, and managing notebooks and scripts.

- Git: Version control system used to track changes and manage the project lifecycle.

- GitHub: Repository hosting, collaboration, and project documentation.

- ChatGPT: Used as a Data Analytics Copilot to assist with prompting, data cleaning strategies, visualization ideas, and analytical reasoning.

## ◼️ Key Takeaways 📌

- Prompt engineering is a core data skill

- ChatGPT accelerates thinking, not judgment

- Healthcare analytics requires careful interpretation

- Simple models + strong reasoning outperform complexity
